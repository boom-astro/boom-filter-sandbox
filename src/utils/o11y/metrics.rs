/// support for delta temporality is still experimental. Cumulative temporality
/// is just fine as long as attribute cardinality doesn't explode.)

/// providers is cheap), to have finer control of how/when it's dropped, or so
/// its `shutdown` method can be called later to manually flush metrics.
