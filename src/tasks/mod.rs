//! The async (typically long-running) task system used to do things like
//! reprocess alerts, download and insert new archival catalogs, etc.
//!
//! See [`docs/task-system.md`](../../docs/task-system.md).
//!
//! Anything that mutates BOOM's data outside the live alert pipeline runs here
//! rather than as a binary someone starts over SSH. That is not only about
//! access: these jobs run for hours to days, so they have to survive a deploy,
//! report their logs while running, and be cancellable, and they have to leave
//! a record of who ran what, when, and with which parameters.
//!
//! A run is submitted through the API, written to `tasks` with
//! `status: queued`, and claimed by the task worker, which holds a lease on it
//! and renews it with a heartbeat. A run whose lease lapses -- because the
//! worker was deployed over or killed -- is requeued and picked up again. Task
//! bodies are therefore written to be **resumable**: re-running one continues
//! rather than repeating.

// TODO: recurring runs, for periodic maintenance such as the LSST cutout
// retention policy (#518). The task document is already ready for them --
// `Trigger::Schedule` and `Actor::system()` exist so a scheduled run is
// distinguishable from one a person asked for, and lease, heartbeat, cancel,
// logs and the ledger are all keyed off the run rather than off what triggered
// it. What is missing is where a schedule is declared and the loop that fires
// it.
//
// Two things to get right, neither of which the current code handles:
//
// 1. **Firing exactly once per tick across a fleet.** Every task-worker wakes
//    at the same cron instant, and `single_flight_key` will not save us: it is
//    a check-then-insert in the API handler (`api::routes::tasks::submit`), not
//    an invariant of `queue::submit`, so a scheduler enqueuing directly bypasses
//    it and two schedulers racing would both pass the check anyway. The fix
//    needs no leader election -- give a scheduled run a deterministic id such
//    as `sched:{schedule}:{unix_fire_time}` and let the `_id` uniqueness Mongo
//    already enforces settle it. One worker inserts, the rest get a duplicate
//    key and move on.
//
// 2. **Missed ticks.** If the fleet was down over a fire time, maintenance work
//    wants skip-to-next rather than a backfilled run per missed tick: the work
//    is cumulative, so one run catches up on all of it.
//
// Note that #518 is an *offload* to S3, not a delete -- Babamul is meant to
// read the archived cutouts back. A TTL index would destroy exactly the data
// the issue wants kept, so this does need a task body: a chunked, resumable
// copy-then-delete of the same shape as `catalog_ingest`, with `CutoutStorage`
// and `copy_cutouts` already covering most of the moving part.
