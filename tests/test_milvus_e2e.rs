#![recursion_limit = "512"] // for large bson docs and CutoutStorage's s3 client
//! End-to-end: a sample ZTF alert flows through the whole stream — ingestion,
//! then the enrichment worker (which runs the CIDER fusion model and upserts the
//! resulting embedding to Milvus) — and is then read back out of Milvus with the
//! similarity-search / query / count APIs.
//!
//! The ZTF enrichment worker only writes embeddings when `milvus.enabled`, so
//! this test is **gated on the config**: with Milvus disabled it logs a skip and
//! returns. That is the case in CI, where `.env` is copied from `.env.example`
//! (`BOOM_MILVUS__ENABLED=false`). To run it for real, set `BOOM_MILVUS__*` in
//! `.env` (see `docs/milvus.md`); it then runs against whatever Milvus those
//! credentials point at, provisioning the collection if it does not yet exist.
